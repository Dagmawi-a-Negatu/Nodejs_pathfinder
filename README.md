Railway Journey
Overview
The Railway Journey is a command-line application designed to find the best routes between two railway stations within a given network. Leveraging a comprehensive railway network graph, the application calculates possible journeys from an origin to a destination station, taking into account the number of allowed transfers.

Features
Custom Railway Network Input: Users can input their own railway network through a JSON file.
Origin to Destination Planning: Given an origin and a destination station, the tool calculates possible routes.
Transfer Limitation: Users can specify the maximum number of transfers allowed for the journey.
Detailed Journey Summaries: For each found route, the application outputs a comprehensive summary, including the route's sequence of stations, total distance, and the number of route changes.
Usage
To use the Railway Journey Planner, run the following command in your terminal, replacing the placeholders with your specific information:

php
Copy code
node network.js <railtrack_file.json> <origin> <destination> <max_transfers>
<railtrack_file.json>: Path to the JSON file containing the railway network graph.
<origin>: The name of the origin station.
<destination>: The name of the destination station.
<max_transfers>: The maximum number of transfers allowed for the journey.
Example
arduino
Copy code
node network.js railtrack_uk.json "Edinburgh" "London" 3
This command searches for routes from "Edinburgh" to "London" with a maximum of 3 transfers, using the railway network defined in railtrack_uk.json.

Project Notes
This is an example of a railway network. A railway network can be built from large data sets of JSON files and then traversed to find the shortest path between two stations. This is one example of a railway system that I built and traversed. One of the many great things I am learning in one simple project in a course. Recursion can get confusing when working with a large dataset and objects have very complex relationships.
